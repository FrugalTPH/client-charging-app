# client-charging-app (2020-01)

A RESTful API I built as a way to learn & experiment with Node.js, Express & MongoDb Atlas.

Its a basic back-end who's functions include user & client account management, subscription charging & invoicing via email, and "model" provision. A "model" referring to an information model for controlling & managing project information in the BIM/PIM arena (e.g. providing a means of managing common data environments).
